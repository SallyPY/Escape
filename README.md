Escape
======

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A room escape game is what it sounds like: a game where a user must get out of a locked room, usually through solving a progression of puzzles. <a href="http://neutralxe.net/esc/sphere_play.html">This</a> is a good example.</p>

<p>My game a simple Java room escape game using eclipse. It will act as my final assignment for my Fall 2014 Intro to Computer Science class. </p>

<p>The code is at the hands of a beginner and a new user to GitHub, so there will be problems on the way.</p>
